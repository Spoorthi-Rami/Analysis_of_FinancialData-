🏦 Company Bankruptcy Prediction Using Machine Learning

📌 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict company bankruptcy based on a range of financial indicators. Accurate prediction can help financial institutions, investors, and auditors mitigate risk and make informed decisions.

🎯 Objective

Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict bankruptcy.
Address the class imbalance in the dataset to improve the detection of companies at high risk of bankruptcy (minority class).
Focus on reducing Type 2 errors (false negatives), which are critical in this context.
⚠️ Challenges

Class Imbalance: The dataset contains significantly fewer bankrupt companies compared to non-bankrupt ones.
High Dimensionality: A large number of financial features may increase risk of overfitting and extend training times.
Error Sensitivity: Type 2 errors are more dangerous in this context than Type 1 errors.
